## About

discordjs-docs-parser is a parser for DiscordJS documentation. It parses the JSON and outputs all the data in a readable
Class format for consumptions. A use case for this library is providing a doc search command in your Discord bot
project. It is also a good way to get a quick overview of the documentation. The prime motivators for this library are
the [Discord Utils Bot](https://github.com/discordjs/discord-utils-bot) and
[Sapphire Application Commands](https://github.com/sapphiredev/sapphire-application-commands) projects.

## Installation

Install with your package manager of choice:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install discordjs-docs-parser
```

## Usage

### Fetching the documentation

The first step is to fetch the documentation. This is done by calling the `fetch` method. After fetching the
documentation it is stored in an in-memory cache (using a `Map`) for later use.

Please refer to [Doc#fetch](Documentation/classes/Doc#fetch) examples and
more information.

### Getting a specific doc element by its name

After fetching the documentation from GitHub and having it stored in the internal cache you can get a specific element
by either it's exact ID or a nested property path.

Please refer to [Doc#get](Documentation/classes/Doc#get) examples and more
information.

### Using a Fuzzy search to find a document element

If you instead of getting the absolute path of a specific element you instead want to perform a fuzzy search for
elements you can use `doc.search`. This will return the top 10 results for the provided query.

Please refer to [Doc#search](Documentation/classes/Doc#search) examples
and more information.
